Father of two 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦, passionate about technology in general, started coding years before Stackoverflow launched. Experienced in building extensive SaaS applications from designing (Lately preferring Figma as a main tool) to writing both front and backend end logic, testing, deployment, including basic server management tasks. 

Here's what you might want to know:

- 😎 - I'm a `Laravel` fan boy 🤙 and will usually reach for `PHP` for my backend.
- 💪 - For my frontend coding I can tackle any vanilla `JavaScript` challenges but I usually prefer working with a framework like `Vue`, `AlpineJS` or `React`. 
- 🎨 - For styling my first choice is `TailwindCSS`, but I'm confortable with (probably all) the other frameworks as well.
- 🌱 - I'm currently Learning `TypeScript` and trying to polish my `ReactJs` Skills.
- ⚡ - My next goal is to get more confortable with the `MERN stack` (`MongoDB` + `Express` + `ReactJS` + `NodeJS`).
- 👯 - Looking to collaborate on interesting open source projects.
