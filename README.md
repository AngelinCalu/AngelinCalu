Father of two 👩‍👩‍👦‍👦, passionate about technology in general, started coding years before Stackoverflow launched. Experienced in building extensive SaaS applications from designing (Lately preferring Figma as a main tool) to writing both front and backend end logic, testing, deployment, including basic server management tasks. 

Here's what you might want to know:

- 😎 - I'm a `Laravel` fan boy 🤙 and will usually reach for `PHP` for my backend.
- ⚡ - I'm confortable working with the `MERN stack` (`MongoDB` + `Express` + `ReactJS` + `NodeJS`). (or `PERN Stack`, with `PostgreSQL` instead of `MongoDB`)
- 💪 - For my frontend coding I can tackle any vanilla `JavaScript` challenges but I usually prefer working with a framework like `React`, `Vue` or `AlpineJS` (depending on the needs). 
- 🎨 - For styling my first choice is `TailwindCSS`, but I'm confortable with (probably all) the other frameworks as well.
- 🌱 - I'm currently getting better at `TypeScript` in both back and front ends.
- 👐 - Things I'd like to get the hang on next: (This list grew too big to display here 😄)
- 👯 - Looking to collaborate on interesting open source projects.
